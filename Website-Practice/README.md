# Web Practice Projects

This folder contains all the basic website practice projects I’ve created to learn and improve my web development skills.

## Purpose

These projects are part of my journey to understand HTML, CSS, and front-end design. Each folder inside includes different types of websites or features that I’ve built to explore layouts, styling, and form elements.

## Skills Practiced

- HTML structure and tags  
- CSS styling and layout  
- Forms and tables  
- Media integration (images, videos, etc.)  
- Responsive design basics

Feel free to explore each folder to see my progress!
